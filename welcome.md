# The Nature of Digital Commentary

## A small step for humanity.

In the age of rapid information exchange, the *slow* art of exegesis has been somewhat lost. We often find ourselves reacting rather than responding, shouting rather than conversing.

When we're thinking together, we're growing together. That's the central idea of this kind of [[exegesis]].

## A Return to the Margins

Historically, the margin was a place of vibrant intellectual activity. It was where the reader met the author, not to destroy the text, but to expand it. As one scholar notes:

> "The gloss is not a correction, but a continuation."

This tool aims to reclaim that space. By treating the digital document not as a finalized binary object, but as a living manuscript, we invite a different kind of collaboration.

### Technical Implications

1.  **Version Control**: Git provides the perfect backend for this, tracking thought over time.
2.  **Interface**: The interface must recede, allowing the thought to come forward.
